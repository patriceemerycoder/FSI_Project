1. Planning the Integration Project• Key Components:I have set up a Blazor front-end for user interaction, a .NET Core API middleware tier for processing logic, and a sql server database for data storage. 

This will insure separation of concerns and a smooth foundation for the project.•

 API Endpoints: I have defined specific API endpoints that will serve as a mode of communication between the front-end and back-end. 

These are CRUD endpoints

.• Tool Selection:

• Blazor for UI• .NET Core for server-side logic,• JWT for secure user authentication.• SQL server database• Mapping User Flows: The user flow is the following:•

 1. Search for a product from the catalog•

 2. Enter a new product into the catalog.•

 3. Delete a product from the catalog.• 

4. Update a product in the user catalog.

2. Developing and Refining Code with Microsoft Copilot• Code Generation:• API Consumption:• Authentication:

3. Optimization and Debugging• Debugging Integration Issues: Used Copilot to quickly identify and resolve integration problems, such as mismatched API endpoints or data format inconsistencies.• 

Performance Enhancements: Optimize integration code by applying best practices of caching api calls and using asynchronous methods.

4. Performance Tuning and Security

• State Management: Implemented effective state management strategies.

• Security Measures: used role based management in the database.

5. Leveraged Copilot for Continuous Improvement  by requesting that copilot improve the code for efficiency and test accordingly.
